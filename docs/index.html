        Title: It’s Corona Time<br />
        Summary: Use your impressive bouncing skills and shooting skills to
        defeat the virus before it infects you.<br />
        By: Brian Lo, Christine Luo, Evan Sum
      </p>
      <h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We don’t know how to use any game engines. We are implementing VR with
          only a phone and no fancy hardware like Oculus, Vive, ect.
        </li>
        <li>
          We also want to make an ability to shoot a bullet or item that will
          bounce, and we want to calculate this using ray tracing or ray
          casting.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will also be trying to create our own textures and our own models
          through Autodesk Maya.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
      <h3 align="middle">What we plan to deliver</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Implement a VR shooting game with only a mobile device and no fancy
          hardware like Oculus, Vive, ect. (The player would hold phone in front
          of them like a window rather than hold it right in front of their
          eyes)
        </li>
        <li>
          Tell when a player taps on a VR object on the screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          Shoot bullets from player to target when valid target tapped.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 align="middle">What we hope to deliver (if have time)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Enemies are animated and explode
        </li>
        <li>
          Upgrades to weapons (piercing bullets . . .)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 align="middle">Why we can accomplish these goals:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Some of us are interested in game development and animation
        </li>
        <li>
          We’ve used 2D game engines like Greenfoot before. How hard can this be
          :).
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/weWant.png" />
        </li>
        <li>
          The above image is a little like what we want to accomplish. The image
          is an AR shooting game, but we want to do VR, so the background won’t
          be real.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 align="middle">Measuring quality/performance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you turn around 360 degrees, the virtual world should rotate with
          the player and the player should return to his/her starting position.
        </li>

        <li>When a player taps on an enemy, the game detects it</li>
        <li>
          When the game detects enemy tap, it shoots a bullet to the enemy and
          destroys it
        </li>
        <li>
          Our models have the correct textures on them.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we have time: models are animated and explode, piercing bullets
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 align="middle">Questions we plan to answer with our analysis</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How we implemented the VR
        </li>
        <li>
          How we detected tapping on an enemy
        </li>
        <li>How we shoot a bullet to the enemy and destroy it</li>
        <li>How we textured our models.</li>
      </ul>
